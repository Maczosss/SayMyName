# SayMyName

This app was developed as part of an engineering thesis. Its main task is to create parent recordings that are sent to the S3 database in the AWS cloud. The Amplify library was used to log in and create users.
Components from this library were also used to safely exchange recordings from the application to the cloud in order to then be able to remotely play them on radios, which firefighters are equipped with.
